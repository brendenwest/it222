### What is Data Reporting?

Often know as `business intelligence (BI)` reporting, this is the process of generating reports or analyses, usually to assist business decision-making.

Reports can be tabular, summarizing the underlying data, or graphical. The process of generating graphical reports is called `data visualization`.

Reporting is largely independent of how data is stored (e.g. text files, spreadsheets, relational DB's, etc.)

BI reporting is an essential business function for more companies.

Historically much BI reporting depended on relational databases and often complex SQL queries. 

Recently, software tools have emerged that allow employees with limited technical skill to perform sophisticated data analysis.

### Key Data Reporting Tools

Many commercial and open-source tools exist for data reporting and it's not feasible to cover all of them here. A few more prominent tools are:
